    """Validates that LLM-generated text is not naming any competitors from a
    given list.

    In order to use this validator you need to provide an extensive list of the
    competitors you want to avoid naming including all common variations.

    Args:
        competitors: (list[str]): A list of competitors to be matched in the output.
        Variations on spelling are handled by the ML model, but the precheck
        (if run) is case-insensitive.  It is advisable to use the most common
        capitalization: i.e., "US Postal Service" instead of "us Postal sErViCe".

        enable_direct_match_prefilter (bool): Defaults to False. If true, will
        perform a case-insensitive search across the text for each of the
        competitors before attempting to use the ML model.  For example, the text,
        "It's a lovely day." does not have the substring 'Guardrails', so there's
        no need to perform a model-based check.  This results in greatly increased
        speed in the case where a competitor is mentioned, but comes at the cost
        of a higher false negative rate.  This value should be set to false if a
        competitor has multiple nuanced spellings or variations in spacing, for
        example: "USPS" and "US Postal Service" and "United States Postal Service" or
        if the competitor is an extremely common term like 'Apple'.

        ignore_locations (bool): Defaults to 'False'.  If true, will discard named
        entities that are recognized as location mentions. This can help to discard
        false positives for companies which happen to share names with directions,
        like Northwestern, but can be problematic for synecdoche, for example:
        "Chicago beat Philadelphia in the 2016 world cup."
